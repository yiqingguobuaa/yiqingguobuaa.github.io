**Abstract:** The IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society
(GRSS) University of New South Wales (UNSW)
Canberra Student Chapter is young and vibrant. It was
formally established in December 2018 and was the
first IEEE GRSS Student Chapter in Australia. Dr. Yiqing
Guo served as the inaugural chair and was succeeded
by Adnan Farooq Awan. Currently, Junpeng Zhang and
Xiaolin Chen serve as the chair and vice chair, respectively. Dr. Xiuping Jia has served as the advisor since the
Student Chapter was established. Based at UNSW Canberra, the Student Chapter brings
together students from the university who share a common interest in geoscience and remote sensing. It provides a platform where members can exchange ideas
and discuss potential opportunities. It also aims to promote geoscience and remote sensing activities by reaching out to nonmember students on campus.
