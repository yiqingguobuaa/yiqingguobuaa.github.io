**Abstract:** Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) could be used as an indicator of photosynthetic status due to the close relationship between SIF and the photosynthetic apparatus. Terrestrial SIF is emitted throughout the red and near-infrared spectrum and is characterized by two peaks centered around 685 nm and 740 nm, respectively. In this study, we present a data-driven approach to reconstruct the terrestrial SIF spectrum from measurements by TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 precursor mission. This approach makes use of solar Fraunhofer lines in the combined spectral windows devoid of strong atmospheric absorption features to retrieve SIF signal from the solar radiation reflected by the surface and atmosphere system. Information contents are mainly from the two windows close to the red and far-red SIF peaks, 663–686 nm and 743–758 nm. A linear forward model represented as an addition of the SIF-free radiance spectrum and the SIF component is proposed with a proper selection of its parameter settings. The SIF component was simulated as linear combinations of 2 basis SIF spectra. Through inverting the linear forward model, the SIF spectrum was retrieved from the solar radiation reflected by the surface and atmosphere system. The evaluation of the retrieval results is performed by inter-comparison with other SIF datasets. The comparisons display similar spatial distributions for the weekly global SIF composites for the first two weeks in June and December of 2019 and July and December of 2021. Especially the comparison of the far-red SIF datasets with other dedicated far-red SIF retrievals demonstrates close agreement, indicating consistency among the retrieval approaches. The reconstructed TROPOMI red SIF shows improved and more reasonable spatiotemporal distributions. The retrieval uncertainty for the weekly global composite is about 12% and 2% of the peak red and far-red SIF values, respectively, which can be considered as satisfactory error thresholds for global composites of SIF observations. Different spectral features for several typical biomes from reconstructed SIF spectra suggest that red and far-red SIF may carry complementary information on photosynthetic function and biophysical properties of the plant. For the first time, the reconstruction of the SIF spectrum is achieved for spaceborne measurements with the potential to open new applications for better understanding of the ecosystem function.
