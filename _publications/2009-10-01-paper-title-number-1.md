title: "Bidirectional reflectance effects over flat land surface from the charge-coupled device data sets of the HJ-1A and HJ-1B satellites"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2013-Bidirectional
excerpt: 'This study presents a method for extracting and normalizing hemispherical-directional reflectance factors (HDRFs) from HJ-1A and HJ-1B CCD imagery using a semiempirical BRDF model, demonstrating the significance of directional effects and the feasibility of HDRF normalization for environmental monitoring.'
