Hi, my name is Yiqing Guo. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at CSIRO, Australia. Google Scholar

I study remote sensing and machine learning, and apply these exciting techniques to agricultural, ecological and environmental problems.

I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Beihang University, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and my PhD degree from the University of New South Wales, Canberra Campus, in 2019, all in remote sensing.

After one and a half years of industry experience, I joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 2020, where I am now a Research Scientist working for CSIRO's AquaWatch Australia mission.

I have authored/co-authored more than 20 peer-reviewed publications. My research outcomes have been published in top journals such as Remote Sens. Environ., ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens., IEEE Trans. Image Process., IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., and IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Magazine.
