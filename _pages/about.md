Hi, my name is Yiqing Guo. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at CSIRO, Australia. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=RIVnOZsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

I study remote sensing and machine learning, and apply these exciting techniques to agricultural, ecological
and environmental problems.

I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Beihang University, in
2012 and 2015, respectively, and my PhD degree from the University of New
South Wales, Canberra Campus, in 2019, all in remote sensing.

After one and a half years of industry experience, I joined the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 2020, where
I am now a Research Scientist working for CSIRO's AquaWatch Australia mission.

I have authored/co-authored more than 20 peer-reviewed publications. My research outcomes have been published in top journals such as _Remote Sens. Environ._, _ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens._, _IEEE Trans. Image Process._, _IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens._, and _IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Magazine_.
